                                <p><strong>Answer:</strong>
                                Most of our Spartans workers are trustworthy persons. Sometimes it may happen to recieve a negative Feedback based on subjective point of view of the employer that can influence in a bad way their reputation on our website. In this case we decided it is better to be able to leave only positive Feedback and write a few words about how the Spartan managed the situation. Also don’t worry if you are having troubles with the Spartan and the way he approached the task, you can always contact the support team and we’ll take care of the problem.</p>

                                    We use this term to refer to a “Self-Employed Person” an independent contractor who reports income earned from self-employment. They are allowed to choose who they work for, how the work is done and when it is done.

                                    First you have to be registered as a “Self-Employed Person” and then you have to fill a form that can be found by clicking the “Become a Spartan” button in the upper-right corner of our website. Give us your your personal details and your bank account.

                                    All you have to do is to create an account and add a post in one of the categories. If you want to be a successful employer, be sure that you treat our Spartans with respect and give them a realistic Feedback based on their actions.

                                    We check our Spartans before we allow them to provide services for you. We make sure the Spartans are well trained so they can give the best out of their work.
